Visualization Challenge
--------------------------

## Task Objective

For this challenge, a client has asked you to create a visual representation of the data that describes top performers among oil & gas wells in Colorado. The most complete, yet representative picture, given the data is desired. Oil and gas sales contribute to revenue, while water production contributes to cost.

## Data Description

Two files have been provided. 

1. `2020_prod_reports.csv` - This file contains reports submitted to the regulatory agency during 2020. It does not contain all of 2020, nor is it limited to production values from 2020.
2. `WELLS_SHP.zip` - This file is an ESRI shapefile format of the all the wells tracked by the regulatory agency. This file may help with visualization.

## Restrictions

You must use Python for this exercise. Any visualization packages can be utilized. You have one week to create the visualization.
